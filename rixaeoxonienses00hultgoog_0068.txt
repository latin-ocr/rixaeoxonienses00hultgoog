‘In the conclusion, the clerks finding none to oppose

’ them, went about the streets, broke up many houses‚

spoiled and took away divers goods‚ and did what
pleased them without any opposition. At length

, they went to the house of Jeffrey de Henksey, one of

the Provosts of the town, and burnt it to the ground.

goods therein. Then did they hasten to the house of
the Mayor, by trade a vintner‚ which place they brake
up, drank as much wine as they could, and wasted the
rest. Complaints were eventually made to the King
by the burghers‚ and threats to take away the pri-
vileges of the University so disturbed the victorious
clerks that many of them quitted Oxford lor North-
ampton and elsewhere?
