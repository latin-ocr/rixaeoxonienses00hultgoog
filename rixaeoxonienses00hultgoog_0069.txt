58 - Rtxas Oxom'enses.

Robert of Gloucester thus describes the scene.

‘His way he nome (took) by Oxensord, bnt the burgesses anon
The gates made against him ol the town each one.

He went end lai withoute towne, atte kinge’s halle

And went forth amorrow with his rnen ulle

The gates, when he was went, were alle up brought

Soon, but Smithe gete, bnt that was undone not. ’
The cierkes had therethrough much solane ilore

To play towards Benmond, annoyed they were therefore.
The builli they bid oft, to grant their solane,

To play and undo that gate, but ior nonght it was.

So that a lew wild hinds a light plan theros nome,

Anda day efter meat with axes thither nome,

And that gate to-hew and todashed there,

And after through Beumond to Hnrewell it bare,

And ‘subvenite sancti' last began to sing,

As man doth when a dead man meu to pitte bring.
Willisrn the Spycer aud Geffray ol Henesei that then were
Porueven‚ and N icole oi Kingestone that was mayor,

Nome oi these clerks and in prison cast,

And would not them delirer, yet the Chaueellor prayed last.
The clerks were moth, the burgenses were so bold .
And threatened to nime more, and ol their wrath little told.
The tirst Thursdsy in lent the burgenses were well iers,
And, the while men were atte meat, ereared two bannus,
And went them forth armed with all their power there,

To defoul all the clerks, ere they iware were.

Aa they earne against All Haiwen with power ro strong

At Seinte Merie chnrche a clerc the common bell rong.
These clerks up hom their meat, and to Gode's grane truste,
And ssw that they were shent, bnt they the better thern anne,
They met with those burgenses and began to shoot fast,
Iwounded there was many one, but the burgenses atte laste
They began to flee last, them thought long ere

. So that the clerks had the streetes soon clear.

The bowyers' shops they broke, and the bows nome each one
Alterwardr the Portrewes houses they set fire anon,

ln the south hali ol the town, and afterwards the Spioerie
They broke irorn endto other and did all to robberie.

For the mayor was vintner, they bmke the vintnerie,

And ull other in the town, and that was little masterie.
