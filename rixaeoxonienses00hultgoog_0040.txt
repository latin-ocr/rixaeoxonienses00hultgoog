before St. Mary’s Church about four ol the clock in the
alternoon‚ and fought with arrows ina hostile manner.
In the conflict the Principal os Hart Hall, then Fellow
os Exeter, a scholar ol St. Alban’s Hah, and ¹another
of Staple Hall were slain, besides many others who
were wounded. Several Merton men were engaged
in the light, of whom Mr. John Foster, Principal os
St. Alban's Hall was the chief ; also Mr. Philip
Dense and Mr. John Wingar, who with their gowns
flung aside were present in the crowd' Riots at
Oxlord were so frequent at this time that there were
thoughts os taking away the privileges ol the Univer-
sity3 ‘and without doubt it would so have come to
pass, had not Warham, Archbishop ol Canterbury,
laboured seasonably with importunate requests to
the contrary!

In 1580, ‘since several decrees had been made for
the orderly keeping of the act, Dr. Mattheus, Dean
oi Christ Church, who was this year Vice·Chancellor‚
resolved to see them severely observed, and soreseeing
some rudeness that was like to be done by the juniors
on Act Monday‚ kept the door leading to the scafiolds
(built theatre-wise at the east end ol St. Mary's
Church) in his own person. And among the divers
academicians that endeavoured to enter, and were by
him repelled, was Dr. Harris, Principal of Brasenose
college, who, though a Head and consequently en-
titled to a place there, was with scorn (the Vice-
Chancellor being probably in a passion) thrust down.'
