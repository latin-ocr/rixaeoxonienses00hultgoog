return the yellows, who went in a cavalcade to the
Bear at Oxford, were followed by a tumultuous rabble,

covering the carriages and horses with filth. On
Magdalen Bridge they surroun'ded a post chaise, in
which was Captain Turton and another person, crying
out “ Over with them; drown them; kill them,'' at the
same time taking hold of the wheels and traces, and
lifting the carriage up. Among others in this mob
was a chimney sweep, who, when the chaise was thus
stopped, threw two pebbles at it and was stooping to
pick up a third, which Turton perceiving, drew a
pistol and shot him dea'd. For this act he was after-
wards tried and acquitted. The mob that espoused the
newinterestwere on some occasions notless tumultuous
and indecent- Among other enormities they got into ι
one os the churches at Oxford and mounting the
pulpit drank “ Damnation to the last blue parson, that
preache'd in that blue pulpit.’' Within aiew weeks the
other party was so violent that they mobbed a gentle·
man into the town ior no other reason, than because
his servant had ·by mere accident wound a piece oi
yellow silk over the fore part oi his horses bridle.’
Oxford was literally placarded with lampoons and
political caricatures and squibs Wenman, who was
said to have attended a seditious meeting in Oxford
