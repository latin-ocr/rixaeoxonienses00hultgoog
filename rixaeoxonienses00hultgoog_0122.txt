guilds was broken down3 strangers were allowed to
trade with the University, and privileged persons
engaged in any handicraft or profession, independent
os the city jurisdiction‚ without admission by the cor-

poration. The University claimed the exclusive right ’

to grant licences to booksellers‚ bookbinders‚ leather-
sellerS, and innkeeperS‚ ‘infra precinctum Universitatis,’
to regulate the price of beer, and the days of brewing‚
and the price and weight of bread. In matters that
concemed the good government of the University,
the Chancellor was empowered to make bye-laws to
bind the City; he inspected the cleansing os the streets,
and regulated the building operations of the Town.
In the words of Mr. J. R. Green‚ ‘ the University found
the City among the first of English municipalities,
and it so utterly crushed its freedom, that the recovery
of some os the commonest rights of sels-government
has only been brought about by recent legislation.’
