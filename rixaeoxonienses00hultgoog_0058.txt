Town und Gown. 47

Gate and All Saints in t'he middle of the King’s
Highway, and the sellers of hogs and pigs stood
between the churches of St. Mary and All Saints on

and paths without the Town. At length the business
was so composed, that the abusers of the Clerks were
sent to Rome to be tried in the Pope’s Court; the
things that were taken from the Clerks were restored ;
and fifty marks were given by the Laics to be divided
among the poor scholars. It was further ordered
that if the like matter should happen again, the said

by whose judgment the fault should be canonieally
punished, all manner of appeal being laid aside.'
In 1232 scholars were killed and wounded in a fray
