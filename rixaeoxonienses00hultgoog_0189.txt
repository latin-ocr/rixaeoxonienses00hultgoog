170 ’ Rixae Oxom'enses,

with great solemnity burned on the Table while the anthemo were
singing. Aster this another produced Milton's ξ’ Defensio Populi
Anglicani'' upon which all laid their hands, and made a protestation
in form of an oath for ever to stand by, and maintain the same!

A verse os the song sung on such occasions ran :-

‘Now let’s sing, carouse, and ποεῖς
The happy day is come once more.
For to revel
Is but civil,
As our Fathers did before3
who, when the Tyrant would enslave us,
Chopped his Calfs Head off to save us.
