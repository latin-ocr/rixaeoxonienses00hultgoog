128 Ranae Oxonienser.

On July 21, 1683, aster the discovery of the alleged
Rye House Plot, the University of Oxiord in Con-
vocation ‘condemned certain pernicious books and
damnable doctrines, as destructive to the sacred
persons of princes, their state and government and of
all human society’3 and passed their celebrated
decree of non-resistance. At the same time Corpus
College caused the name of the Duke of Monmouth‚
which he had entered in the college buttery book, to
be erased. On September 9, Thanksgiving Day, the
city had entertainment oi wine, music, a hartel of ale
and a fire at Penniless Bench; in a pump below the
Star Inn was a tub set and ‘Presbyter' therein
preaching; ‘all the smart lads oi the city marched
down the streets with cudgels in their hands crying
for the King, and the Duke oi York, and all the
people had “ York'’ in their mouths, and his health
was drank publicly at most Halls after dinner.’

built at Cariax, the Mayor and brethren proceeded in

don and the officers oi militia. But all these expres-
sions of loyalty went for nought. James rode
roughshod over the privileges of ' the University,
created Massey, an avowed Papist, Dean of Christ
