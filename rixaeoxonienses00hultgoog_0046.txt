T lze Batlles of tle Nations. 37

Chaplain or Priest oi the said Parish, wherein the Clerk dwelt‚ was
passing by the window oi the lower room carrying with him the Lord’s
Body to a certain sick person, whom, when the Devil saw through the
window, he presently at the sight of the Chaplain bent his knees with
lifting up of his hands, continuing in this position, till he had passed by
the place. The Clerk observing this, took special notice of it. After-
wurd the Clerk proceeded in his questions and discussed of several
things with the Devil. At length the Chaplain returned without the
Lord's Body, and passing by the same place, the Devil at sight of him
beut but one knee, which the Clerk noting admired at, and adjured him
to give the reason why he should bend both knees when the Chaplain
went by, and but one knee when he returned. To which the Devil
confessed that he was sorced whether he would or not, to do it, to the
end that honour might be given to the Lord's Body as it passed by,
with both knees, and to the Chaplain in his return with but one,
bemuse oi his reverence and that he was the officer of the Lord. The
Clerk thereupon being much troubled and concluding with himself
that the Lord's Body was more master of the Devil than he, (which
without demur the Devil confessed), removed him from t'ne plaoe, gave
him hiswages according to the manner, aud forthwith renouncing his
art and skill in necromaney bumt all his books, aud repented he had
spent so much time therein.

About the same time, a certain scholar aiter he had been labouring at
his book all day, went at the usual hour to bed very well and cheeriul,
as seholars used to be aster a good day's work. But in the middle oi
the night agreat noise arose, whereupon his iellows that laid in the
same chamber being disturbed‚ arose to see what the matter was, aud
straightway found their sellow elerk grovelling on the ground, mute and
in a manner dead, whereupon a strange consternation seizing them, one
of the Clerks said ‘¹ let us go to Prayers, and repeat the beginning of
the Gospel of St. John, ior without doubt he is possessed with the Devil’
To which proposal all agreeing and making answer to him that prayed
and read, the Devil, who had possessed their brother, leit him, and
going down the stone steps which led to the solar or chamber, leit
behind him such a filthy smell that the Clerks were almost killed by it.’
