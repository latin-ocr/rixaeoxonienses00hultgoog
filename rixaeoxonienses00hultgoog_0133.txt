House. The scene is described by Wood ; ‘ To prevent

all cavil the Vice-Chancellor, when he perceived it to
draw towards eleven, sent a command to the Univer-
sity clerk that he should be careful to observe the sun, ,
and see that his clock kept pace with it exactly.
When the clock struck eleven the vice-chanceuor,
Doctors and Proctors being in the Apoditerium, en-
tered immediately into the Convocation House‚ and
there declared by the mouth of one of the Proctors,
that ‘whereas they had been cited to appear there
that day between the hours of nine and eleven, they
had obeyed‚ and because the time limited had then
expired, they held themselves not obliged to further
attendance.’ Whereupon the Vice-Chancellor gave
command that they should every man repair home to
their several colleges. ln their return, as the Vice-
Chancellor and Doctors were marching in a full body
with the Bedells before them, they met the visitors in
the Proscholium by the Divinity School door, where
the passage is somewhat narrow. Upon this, one of
the Bedells, abold fellow‚ called to them ‘Room for
Mr. Vice-Chancellor,' upon which they were pleased
to deny themselves and gave the way. The Vice-
Chancellor very civilly moved his cap to them, saying
‘Good morroW, gentlemen‚ 'tis past eleven of the cloclg'
and so passed without taking further notice of them.
Upon this, there followed a great hum from the
scholars, and so they parted, they holding on to their
place of visitation and the scholars to their dinners.
