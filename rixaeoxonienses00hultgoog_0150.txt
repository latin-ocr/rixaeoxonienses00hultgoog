to have given leave to the French ambassador to
raise a regiment of 1000 rnen in England sor the
king's guards to attend him at his landing‚ and 700 were
said to be already enlisted and quartered in Southwark.

Oxonians; the attendance of masters and doctors
at the solemnity was very small; there was very

at a venture, lie and prate what nonsense they pleased;
