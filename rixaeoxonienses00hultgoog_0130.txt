Stuart Oxford. 115

Rupert,Prince Maurice,and his sons Charles and James,
marched through North Gate, fresh from Edgehill‚ with
some sixty or seventy colours captured from the rebels.
Steps were taken to disarm the citizens and to fortify
the place. The situation os Oxford was apt lor de-
fence, being placed within the river Isis on the west,
and Cherwell on the east, both meeting on the south
side. These rivers were so ordered by locks and
sluices that the city could be surrounded by water on
three sides. On the north, according to a plan of
fortification drawn by Rallingson,a Β.Α. of Queen’s
College, were built many strong hulwarks strongly set
with palisades and deep ditches. The University
Bellman summoned all privileged persons, that were

housekeepers‚ to send some of their family to dig at
¹ the works; citizens were told off to work at hulwarks
, to the north os St. Giles' Church; all scholars over

sixteen were required to work at least one daya week,
or pay a fine of one shilling.

Arms and ammunition were stored in New College
tower and cloisters3 corn was laid in the law and
logie schools‚ victuals in the Guild Hall, clothes of
soldiers in the music and astronomy schools; gun·
powder was made at Oseney Mill; a mint was set up
at N ew Inn, whither all the colleges were ordered to
send their plate. Lectures ceased, the lecturers
became recruiting sergeants; gown gave way to mili-
tary coat, square cap to helmet3 ‘Minerva disappeared
from Oxsord to reappear as Pallas?
