Jacobile Oxford. 143

Papists, Irish officers, and several notorious Jacobites ,
were in sanctuary there, and fermenting the spirit
oi rebellion, and drinking publicly and uncontrolledly

ἶ the Pretender's health, and suspecting that they

contemplated an insurrection in conjunction with
the disaffected at Bath and Bristol‚ it was resolved ·
to secure their persons. Major General Pepper, being

¹ charged with this commission, sent one os his officers,

disguised as a countryman, to Oxiord, to get in-
telligence and view the approaches and principal
posts os the town, and then began to move himself
with his own regiment oi dragoons, bending his
march towards Bath and Bristol. But on the 5th
oi October, being then within seven or eight miles
oi Oxiord, instead os resting, he travelled all night,
· and entered the city early next morning. Having
caused his men to alight and fix bayonets, he im-
mediately secured all the avenues of the town, and
the gates os every iun and public house. Then
sending sor the Vice·Chancellor‚ and the Mayor,
he shewed them letters “ irorn Secretary Stanhope, ,
and acquainted them with his orders, to seize sixteen
or eighteen suspected persons. He desired the
Vice-Chancellor to keep the Fellows and Scholars
within College, and declared that is any disturbance
should arise‚ or there should be any great number
oi people in the streets, he would cause his mento
frre upon them. A search was then commenced.
Colonel Owen, who lay that night at the Grey Hound
