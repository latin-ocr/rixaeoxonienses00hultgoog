to light any bonfires, at any other time of the day,

at which time the University bonfire was usually
made before the Church doors Public houses were
ordered to close to all, except travellers, at nine
o'clock, an hour signified by the tolling of the great
bell at Christ Church. The result of these orders was
eminently satisfactory. Thanksgiving day was a
failure, ‘the bells were only jambled by silly persons
and a parcel of children, but there was not so much as
one good peal rung in Oxford 3 many shops were open,
and such as kept them shut did it more out of sorrow
than joy.' The thanksgiving service was scantily
attended.

During July and August of this year, there were
constant rumours in Oxford‚ of the landing of the
Pretender in Scotland. Amherst in his ‘ Terrae Filius'

states that ‘ Captain Owen, a notorious Jacobite‚ aud κ
other leading rnen of the party were entertained by ,

the heads of houses ; they walked about the streets
with a mob at their heels, huzzaing ‘King James, and
the Duke of Ormond' and ‘No Usurpers’; Whigs
went in fear of their lives; portraits of the Pretender
were sold in the town, and Heame purchased one

for half-a-guinea; great number of students were ,

. enlisted3 all horses fit for service were marked; and
the notification of the landing of the Duke of Ormond,

was the only thing wanted, before breaking into open
warfare.’
