Baillives were imprisoned in the Tower os London,
and according to some reports were afterwards
hanged. Both corporations, City and University,
surrendered their privileges into the hand os the
King, and their representatives were summoned to
appear in London. The King by his letters requested
the scholars to resume their studies, and by the end
of the year many had returned to Oxlord again.

A very large charter ol privileges was soon after
granted the University. The custody and assize of
bread, wine, and ale, the supervision ol measures and
weights, were placed under the sole control ol the
Chancello'r. To him also were granted the sole
cognisance of forestallers and regrators, the correc-
tion of victuals, the power of collecting tribute from
scholars' servants, and ol cleansing the streets of the
town and suburbs. It was also ordered that those
who had robbed the scholars should be prosecuted,
that the Sheriff ol the county should take an oath
on entering office to observe the privileges of the
University, and that the Mayor and Baillives should
deliver into the hands ol the Chancellor, the standard
of weights and measures with the seal lor signing
them.

The Kingâ€™s Council subsequently imposed a fine
ol two hundred and fifty pounds as damages sor all
injuries, except death, which had been done to the
scholars.
