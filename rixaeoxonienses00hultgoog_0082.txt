Toron and Goion. 71

upon the Town Bell being rung out first, and after that,
the University Bell, divers scholars issued out armed,
with bows and arrows in their own deience, and ol their
commnione, and having first shut and blocked up some
ol the gates of the town (lest the country people who
were then gathered together in innumerable multi-
tudes might suddenly break in upon their rear in
hostile manner, and assist the townsmen, who were
now ready in battle array, and armed with their
targets also), they fought with them and defended
themselves till aster vesper-tide3 a little alter which
time, entered into the town by the West gate about
two thousand countrymen with a black dismal flag,
erect and displayed. of which the scholars having
notice, and being unable to resist so great and fierce
a company, they withdrew themselves to their

lodgings’ :—

Urebat portas agrestis plebs populosa,

Post res distortas videas quae sunt vitiosa

Vexillum geritur nigrum ; ‘Slea,’ ‘Slea' recitatur,

Credunt quod moritur Rex, vel quod sic humilietur.

Clamant ‘Havock' et ‘Havoclr'3 non sit qui salvificem

‘ Smyt last, give gode knocks' nullus poet baec dominetur.
Thus part of a piece oi poetry made in those times,
concerning the said conflict The townsmen, finding
no scholars in the streets to make opposition, pursued
them, and that day they broke open five Inns or

Hostles of scholars with fire and swordz-

l Invadunt aulaa3 ‘By the sun come sorth’ geminantes,

fregerunt muas, suun omna vi spoliantes.
